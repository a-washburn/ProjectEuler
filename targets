#169 <-- bit-twiddling h4x! (possible deterministic equation)
#206 <-- take sqrt of lowest number and increasingly search through squares

Pythagorean Triangles:
#139,#218,#283

An expected value problem:
#323

!!! Clean-Up p0017, use logs,	be more verbose

!!! Clean-Up p0019, use enums,	clean up logic

!!! Clean-Up p0025, use logs,	not strings
